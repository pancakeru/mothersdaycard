        Dear Ma, <br />
        Happy Mother's Day! I want you to know that you are an extraordinarily accomplished and diligent person that
        inspires me to be the best version of myself that I can possibly be. I cherish the moments we spend together because it's fun to talk about
        girly stuff and I get to learn so much about you. I know that sometimes I may come off as distant or annoyed, but
        you are always understanding and cheer me up. I cannot express enough gratitude for everything you've done, for me,
        Eric, Pa, and Nicholas. We may joke that you are always nagging, but deep down we know that without you we would
        not be the people we are today. You have taught me so much and I am grateful for all the opportunities you
        have given me, and as your daughter, my biggest goal is to make you proud. You are a great mom, and I look forward
        to spending more time with you in Montreal this summer! <br />

        <span class="signature">
            Much love, <br /> Zoe
